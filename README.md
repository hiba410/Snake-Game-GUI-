# 🐍 Snake Game (Java GUI)

This project is a **classic Snake Game** built using **Java** with a **Graphical User Interface (GUI)**.  
It was developed as part of my programming practice to strengthen **Java GUI concepts, object-oriented programming (OOP)**, and **game development basics**.

## 🎮 Features
- 🟩 **Snake Movement** – Control the snake with arrow keys (Up, Down, Left, Right).  
- 🍎 **Food Generation** – Random food appears on the board.  
- 📈 **Score System** – Score increases when the snake eats food.  
- 🐍 **Snake Growth** – Snake grows longer each time it eats food.  
- ☠️ **Game Over** – Game ends if the snake collides with itself or the wall.  
- 🎨 **GUI Interface** – Built with **Java Swing** for a smooth user experience.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Java** (Core Java, OOP concepts)  
- **Java Swing** – For GUI components  
- **Java AWT** – For rendering graphics

## 🎥 Gameplay
- Use **Arrow Keys** to move the snake.  
- Eat the **red apple** to grow and increase your score.  
- Avoid hitting the **walls** or the **snake’s body**.

## 📊 Future Improvements
- Add **difficulty levels** (Easy, Medium, Hard).  
- Include **background music & sound effects**.  
- Add **pause & restart** functionality.  
- Improve graphics with **custom images** for snake and food.
